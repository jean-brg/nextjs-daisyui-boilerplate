# NextJS DiasyUI Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate based off `create-next-app` with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for styled components and utility classes.
Nothing fancy, just a little code to make set up faster.

## Installation
Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jean-brg/nextjs-daisyui-boilerplate.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
This boilerplate comes pre-configured with:
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
- **DaisyUI**: A set of pre-designed components built on top of Tailwind.
